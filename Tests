Test scenarios:

- Add and delete several files from different locations. Repeat the cycle several times.
RESULT: PASS. However it is possible to add two copies of .mp3 from different locations with
the same name. In this case only one file will be copied to the target directory.

- No folder exists yet. Create a playlist with three files.
RESULT: PASS.

- Add another three files (one should already exists in a folder). Press "Add"
RESULT: PASS.

- Add three other files (one should already exists in a folder). Press "Replace"
RESULT: PASS.

- Add three other files (one should already exists in a folder). Press "Cancel"
RESULT: PASS.

- Add three other files (one should already exists in a folder). Press "Replace". This time
try to engage a folder
RESULT: PASS.

- Add three other files (one should already exists in a folder). Press "ADD". This time
try to engage files
RESULT: PASS.

- Add three other files (one should already exists in a folder). Press "Replace". This time
try to engage files
RESULT: PASS. However the program is not able to create a proper playlist if some of the files
in the target directory are engaged in this case. This is a WEAKNESS in the program

Improvements in future versions:
- remove a weakness when the program is not able to create a proper playlist if some of the files
in the target directory are engaged.
- add different type of music files
- allow a user to configure a playlist directory in GUI
- add a button which will open target directory
- add about dialog
- add help system
